PSMoveFreepieBridge is a client for [PSMoveService](https://github.com/cboulay/PSMoveService) that takes the location and rotation data of a controller and passes it into [FreePIE](https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/).

This version is based on hawkinse's [PSMoveFreePIEBridge](https://bitbucket.org/hawkinse/psmovefreepiebridge/src/master/)
